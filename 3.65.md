The following code transposes the elements of an M Ã— M array, where M is a constant defined by #define:

```c
void transpose(long A[M][M]) {
  long i, j;
  for (i = 0; i < M; i++)
  	for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    	long t = A[i][j];
   		A[i][j] = A[j][i];
   		A[j][i] = t;
  	}
}
```



```assembly
.L6:
movq (%rdx), %rcx  # long rcx = *rdx
movq (%rax), %rsi  # long rsi = *rax
movq %rsi, (%rdx)  # *rdx = rsi
movq %rcx, (%rax)  # *rax = rcx
addq $8, %rdx      # divide by the size of the type (8/8) rdx =+ 1
addq $120, %rax    # rax =+ 15  (120/8)
cmpq %rdi, %rax    # if rdi != rax, jump to L6
jne .L6
```



**<u>Explanation:</u>** 

**A. Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[i][j]`?**

`rdx` is incremented by 1 each loop, so it points to `A[i][j]`. 
Each column is 8 bytes (1 long) distanced from the next column. `A[i][j] -> A[i][j+1]`



**B. Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[j][i]`?**

`rax` is incremented by 120 bytes (15 long) each loop, so it points to `A[j][i]` . It's moved to the `j+1` row and `ith` column.

Each row is 120 bytes (15 long) distanced from the next row. `A[j][i] -> A[j+1][i]`



**C. What is the value of M?**

Value of M is **120** bytes/**8** bytes = 15.

Each long type is 8 bytes in x86 ISA.
